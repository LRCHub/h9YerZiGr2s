```
Bank roll, thumbin', baby,
you know how I'm comin'
Booty on bubonic and I move
it how I want it
Big girl shit, baby, I don't
do no runnin'
I can make it boom-boom
clap like I'm drummin'
Shake it, make it tick,
tick, tick, brum-bumpin'
Shake it, make it tick,
tick, tick,
tick, brum-bum-bumpin'
Whippin' shit, I could
turn nothin' into somethin'
Pop it, make it tick,
tick, tick, bum-bum-bumpin'
I can make your nigga hit
the race if I wanted
Baby, I could take your place
if I wanted
I could hit the bank and
spend this cake if I wanted
Told me I could put the
diamonds on them face if
I wanted
If you let me take him,
you might never get him back
I'm a baddie and I don't
know how to act
Booty candy painted with
the diamond in the back
It's too bad your nigga
don't know how to act
When I'm finished, baby, you
can have him back
Mhm, baby, you can have him back
Booty candy painted with
the diamond in the back
It's too bad your nigga
don't know how to
Act 'round the baddest,
he used to average
Don't know what bad is,
I'll show you bad
I took my wrist, AP'd it up
I took my neck and freezed it up
I took my whip to speed it up
I need a nigga to beat it
up while I'm
(Mm)
Shake it, make it tick,
tick, tick, brum-bumpin'
Shake it, make it tick,
tick, tick,
tick, brum-bum-bumpin'
Whippin' shit, I could
turn nothin' into somethin'
Pop it, make it tick,
tick, tick, bum-bum-bumpin'
I can make your nigga hit
the race if I wanted
Baby, I could take your place
if I wanted
I could hit the bank and
spend this cake if I wanted
Told me I could put the
diamonds on them face if
I wanted
If you let me take him,
you might never get him back
I'm a baddie and I don't
know how to act
Booty candy painted with
the diamond in the back
It's too bad your nigga
don't know how to act
When I'm finished, baby, you
can have him back
Mhm, baby, you can have him back
Booty candy painted with
the diamond in the back
It's too bad your nigga
don't know how to
Handle me
Sweet just like candy
Sweet, sweet
Taste just like candy
Handle me
Sweet just like candy
Sweet, sweet
Taste just like candy
If you let me take him,
you might never get him back
I'm a baddie and I don't
know how to act
Booty candy painted with
the diamond in the back
It's too bad your nigga
don't know how to act
When I'm finished, baby, you
can have him back
Mhm, baby, you can have him back
Booty candy painted with
the diamond in the back
It's too bad your nigga
don't know how to
