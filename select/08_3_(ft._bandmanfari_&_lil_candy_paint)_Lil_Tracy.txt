I was so broke, I had to fix that (I had to fix that)

I just want some head, I'm on fitted cap (Damn, damn)
Talkin' 'bout that bread, I ain't sharin' that (Nah) (Yuh)

You just like a running back

I need a hunnid racks (I need a hunnid racks)
And baby girl, she came for sex, but I'm not into that (Nah)
I'm talkin' honest, big gleezy, it got kickback

Diamonds on my face like Christmas, I'm the light man (Big facts)
Step out fresh, every time, like a white man
Pull up shootin' shit, hop out in a minivan
In New York, smokin' sour, got it from the land (No cap)
Hit the bank, that's my favorite place, don't need no friends (No cap)
